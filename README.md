**Q1**: Why are readme's in github in the .md format? What is .md and why does github use it instead of .txt, .html .docx, or any other file format?  

**Answer**: Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.  
It's popular in formating readme files, since it allows writers to create rich text using plain text editor  

**Q2**: Is the keyword "fixes" the only way to auto-close an issue from a PR 
(pull request). Is there other keywords that can accomplish the same thing?  

**Answer**: No, there are many other keywords that can link a PR with an issue. Such as:  
- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
- fixed
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved

**Q3**: Do you have to create a new PR EVERYTIME you want to close an issue,
or is it possible to close multiple issues within a single PR? If so, 
how?  
**Answer**: No. You can manually close an issue, and it's also possible to close multiple issues by a single PR, just by adding all the issue numbers prefixing with a keyword in the PR message body.  
>For example: fixes #1, fixes #2
